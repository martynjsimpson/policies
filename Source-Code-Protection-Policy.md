# Source Code Protection Policy

[TOC[]

## Purpose

The purpose of this source code protection policy is to establish guidelines and measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our organization's source code assets.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to our organization's source code, whether in digital or printed form.

## Ownership and Access Rights

- All source code developed by employees or contractors while working for our organization is considered the property of the organization.
- Access to source code repositories and development environments should be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel should have access to the source code required to perform their duties.

## Physical Security

- Physical copies of source code, including printouts and backup media, must be stored in locked and secure areas accessible only to authorized personnel.
- Physical access controls, such as key cards or biometric systems, should be implemented to restrict access to areas where physical copies of source code are stored.

## Digital Security

- Source code repositories and version control systems must be protected with strong access controls, including unique user accounts, strong passwords, and two-factor authentication (2FA) where available.
- Regular backups of source code repositories should be performed and stored securely off-site.
- Encryption should be employed for transmitting and storing source code files to protect against unauthorized access or interception.
- Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address security weaknesses in the development environment.

## Source Code Handling

- Source code must not be shared with unauthorized individuals or third parties without prior approval from appropriate management.
- Source code must not be stored on personal devices or cloud storage accounts unless specifically authorized for remote work purposes.
- Source code files should be labeled with appropriate classifications (e.g., confidential, proprietary) to ensure proper handling and protection.

## Employee Awareness and Training

- All employees with access to source code must receive training on the importance of code protection, secure coding practices, and the obligations defined in this policy.
- Regular awareness campaigns and updates should be conducted to keep employees informed about the latest security threats and best practices.

## Incident Reporting and Response

- Any suspected or actual incidents involving unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of source code must be reported immediately to the designated IT or security personnel.
- An incident response plan should be in place to handle and mitigate any potential security breaches involving source code.

## Policy Compliance and Enforcement

- Compliance with this source code protection policy is mandatory for all personnel with access to source code, and non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
- Regular audits and reviews should be conducted to ensure adherence to the policy, and any violations should be appropriately addressed.

## Policy Review

This source code protection policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to address emerging threats or changes in the organizational environment.
