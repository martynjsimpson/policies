- Define retention periods for different types of logs, considering regulatory requirements and business needs.
- Ensure that log files are protected against unauthorized access, tampering, and deletion.

## Log Monitoring and Analysis

- Establish procedures for regular monitoring and analysis of log data to identify potential security incidents or anomalies.
- Define log review processes, including frequency, responsibilities, and escalation procedures.
- Implement log analysis tools and techniques to automate the detection of security events, patterns, and indicators of compromise.
- Utilize threat intelligence feeds and known attack signatures to enhance log analysis capabilities.

## Log Integrity and Protection

- Implement measures to ensure the integrity and reliability of log data throughout its lifecycle.
- Implement secure log transmission protocols, such as encryption, when transmitting logs between systems or to external entities.
- Protect log storage and archival systems against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.

- Collaborate with incident response teams and legal departments to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

## Compliance and Reporting

- Ensure log management practices comply with relevant regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.
- Generate regular reports and metrics to track log management activities, such as log collection, monitoring, and incident response.
- Retain logs and generate audit trails to support compliance audits and investigations.

## Access and Privileges

- Define access controls and privileges for log management systems, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
- Implement mechanisms to authenticate and authorize users accessing log management systems.
- Monitor and log access to log management systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access.

## Employee Awareness and Training

- Provide training and awareness programs to employees regarding the importance of log management and the role they play in reporting and reviewing logs.
- Educate employees on the significance of log data in detecting and responding to security incidents.

## Policy Review
