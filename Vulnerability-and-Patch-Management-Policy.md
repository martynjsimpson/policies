# Vulnerability and Patch Management Policy

[TOC]

## Purpose

- The purpose of this Vulnerability and Patch Management Policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for identifying, assessing, and addressing vulnerabilities in software, systems, and applications within the organization. The policy aims to minimize the risk of exploitation and unauthorized access by ensuring timely patching and mitigation of known vulnerabilities.

## Scope

- This policy applies to all software, systems, and applications owned or operated by the organization, including those hosted internally or in cloud environments.

## Vulnerability Assessment

- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments on all systems and applications to identify potential security weaknesses.
- Utilize automated scanning tools, manual testing, and third-party assessments to identify vulnerabilities.
- Establish a schedule for vulnerability scanning and assessments, considering factors such as system criticality and risk levels.

## Vulnerability Prioritization and Risk Assessment

- Establish a process for prioritizing identified vulnerabilities based on their severity, exploitability, and potential impact.
- Conduct risk assessments to evaluate the potential impact of unpatched vulnerabilities on the organization's systems, data, and operations.
- Define risk acceptance criteria and establish thresholds for prioritizing and addressing vulnerabilities.
- Consider adopting a Severity rating and provide references to standard classifications such as CVSS scores.

## Patch Management

- Implement a systematic patch management process to address identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
- Regularly monitor vendor releases, security advisories, and vulnerability databases for patches and updates.
- Establish procedures for testing and deploying patches, considering factors such as system criticality, patch stability, and compatibility.

## Patch Deployment

- Establish procedures for deploying patches in a controlled manner to minimize disruption to system availability and operations.
- Implement a test environment to validate patches before deployment to production systems.
- Define maintenance windows or schedules for applying patches to minimize service disruptions.

## Patch Verification and Compliance

- Implement mechanisms to verify the successful deployment of patches and ensure systems are properly updated.
- Conduct post-patch verification to confirm that vulnerabilities have been remediated and systems are functioning as expected.
- Regularly monitor and assess compliance with patch management procedures and requirements.

## Patch Management for Third-Party Software and Applications

- Establish procedures for managing patches and updates for third-party software and applications used within the organization.
- Ensure that third-party vendors are responsible for promptly releasing and providing patches for their products.
- Monitor and assess third-party patch management practices to ensure they align with the organization's requirements.

## Vulnerability Response and Incident Handling

- Establish procedures for responding to critical vulnerabilities and security incidents related to unpatched systems or applications.
- Define escalation paths, incident reporting requirements, and response timelines.
- Coordinate with relevant teams, such as IT, security, and incident response, to address vulnerabilities and mitigate associated risks.

## Employee Awareness and Training

- Provide training and awareness programs to employees regarding the importance of vulnerability management and the role they play in reporting vulnerabilities.
- Educate employees on safe computing practices, such as avoiding suspicious links or email attachments that may introduce vulnerabilities.

## Policy Review

- Regularly review and update the Vulnerability and Patch Management Policy to align with changing technology landscapes, emerging threats, and industry best practices.
- Involve key stakeholders, such as IT, security, and compliance departments, in the policy review process.
