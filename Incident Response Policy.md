# Incident Response Policy

## Purpose

- The purpose of this Incident Response Policy is to establish a framework and guidelines for effectively responding to and managing security incidents within the organization. The policy aims to minimize the impact of security incidents, protect critical assets, and facilitate a timely and coordinated response.

## Incident Response Team

- Define roles and responsibilities for the Incident Response Team (IRT), including incident coordinators, investigators, technical experts, and communication personnel.
- Identify the IRT members and their contact information, including backup personnel in case of unavailability.

## Incident Classification

- Establish a classification system to categorize security incidents based on their severity and potential impact.
- Define the criteria for incident classification, such as data breaches, system compromises, unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and service disruptions.

## Incident Reporting

- Clearly define the procedures and channels for reporting security incidents, including contact information for the Incident Response Team.
- Specify the timeframe within which incidents should be reported to ensure a prompt response.

## Incident Response Process

- Outline a step-by-step incident response process that includes the following key stages:
  - Identification and initial assessment of the incident
  - Containment and isolation of affected systems or assets
  - Evidence gathering and preservation
  - Analysis and investigation of the incident
  - Mitigation and eradication of the incident
  - Recovery and restoration of affected systems or assets
  - Post-incident review and lessons learned

## Communication and Notification

- Establish guidelines for internal and external communication during a security incident.
- Define the stakeholders who should be informed, including senior management, legal, human resources, and relevant regulatory bodies or authorities.
- Determine the circumstances under which affected individuals or customers should be notified, in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations.

## Documentation and Reporting

- Emphasize the importance of documenting all actions, findings, and outcomes related to incident response.
- Maintain an incident response log that captures details such as incident date and time, description, actions taken, and responsible parties.
- Require incident reports to be generated after each security incident, outlining the incident's impact, root cause analysis, lessons learned, and recommendations for improvement.

## Escalation and Coordination

- Establish escalation procedures for escalating incidents to higher levels of management or specialized teams when necessary.
- Define coordination mechanisms with external parties, such as law enforcement agencies, incident response service providers, or other affected organizations, to ensure a collaborative response.

## Training and Awareness

- Provide regular training and awareness programs for employees, including incident response procedures, identification of potential indicators of compromise, and reporting mechanisms.
- Conduct periodic drills or simulations to test the effectiveness of the incident response process and identify areas for improvement.

## Policy Review

- Regularly review and update the Incident Response Policy to align with emerging threats, industry best practices, and changes in technology or regulations.
- Involve key stakeholders, including IT, security teams, legal, and executive management, in the policy review process.
